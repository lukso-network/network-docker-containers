# LUKSO Docker containers

This repo provides a base template to use Docker images to run LUKSO node validator nodes).

Note: it has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04. It won't work on macOS (because of `network_mode: host`).

LUKSO network configs are fetched from: [lukso-network/network-configs](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs).

It is provided "as is" and you are encouraged to adjust the configuration files for your own needs. The most important configuration files are the genesis files:

- `genesis.ssz`
- `genesis.json`

They can be found in our [`lukso-network/network-configs`](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs) repo.

For more information, check the [LUKSO Docs](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/mainnet/running-a-node/).

## How to use

1. Log into your node.
2. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
   Here is a tutorial for [Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-22-04)

3. Clone the repo.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:lukso-network/network-docker-containers.git
cd network-docker-containers
```

⚠️ NOTE: if you want to support multiple networks, it is recommended to clone this repo again and work from different directories. This is to avoid mixing data and keystore folders.

4. Download the config files from [`lukso-network/network-configs`](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs) repo.

```
mkdir configs
wget -O ./configs/genesis.ssz https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukso-network/network-configs/main/mainnet/shared/genesis.ssz
wget -O ./configs/genesis.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukso-network/network-configs/main/mainnet/shared/genesis.json
wget -O ./configs/config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukso-network/network-configs/main/mainnet/shared/config.yaml
```

5. **IMPORTANT:** Create `.env` file and adjust the values in `.env` file (node name, fee recipient address, etc.).

```
cp .env.example .env
```

6. Copy your `keystore-xxx.json` files in the [`./keystores/`](./keystores) folder.

7. Write your keystore password in a temporary txt file:

```sh
echo "yourPassword" > /tmp/secrets/password.txt
```

NOTE 1: This password will also be used for the validator wallet.

NOTE 2: You can set your keystore password differently by changing the configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the `prysm_validator_import` service.

8. Start the services:

```sh
docker compose up

# To run in the background, use detached mode with -d flag
```

### Erigon

An example docker compose file for erigon is provided in [`docker-compose.erigon.yml`](./docker-compose.erigon.yml). It only supports erigon execution engine. You will need to run an execution engine for your node to work properly. This file is provded "as is" and you can reuse it in the main `docker-compose.yml` file if you wish to use erigon client instead of geth.

### Useful commands

Check the status of the containers:

```sh
docker ps

# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                       COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                         PORTS                    NAMES
# 1ffeefcbcfb4   prysmaticlabs/prysm-validator:v4.0.8        "/app/cmd/validator/…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute                                       prysm_validator
# 1dff26d8026a   prysmaticlabs/prysm-beacon-chain:v4.0.8     "/app/cmd/beacon-cha…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute                                       prysm_beacon
# b3e2c814ddb5   ethereum/client-go:v1.13.1                  "geth --config /conf…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute                                       geth
```

Check the logs to make sure everything is running fine:

```sh
docker compose logs -f geth

# You can see the logs of each service:
# docker compose logs -f prysm_validator
# ...
```

## Monitoring

We provide another repo which can help you set up monitoring for your node: [`lukso-network/network-docker-monitoring`](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-docker-monitoring).

### Execution stats

To add your node on the [execution stats page](https://stats.execution.mainnet.lukso.network/), fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6_vflZkaRh8dgHMiFtZI5g3DrBFKP4Sc2l2DBW95OWRFO9g/viewform) to receive the secret.

You will then need to update these values in the [`.env`](./.env) file:

```
NODE_NAME=myNodeName
ETH_STATS_SECRET=xxx
```
